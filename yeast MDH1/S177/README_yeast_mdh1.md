# Homo sapiens MDH2
# Uniprot ID: P40926
# Variation: acetylation of K91 (K67 in structure)


## Description
Lysine 91 in human MDH2 has been identified as a post-translationally modified site by Zahn and coworkers in 2010. There are so far no functional studies of the role of this site in human metabolism.

# Comparison of MDH2 models and acetyl modified MDH2

1. Alignment of MDH2, MDH2 with acetylK91 (pink), and K91Q (blue)

## Effect of the sequence variant and PTM on MDH dynamics


1. Image of aligned PDB files (no solvent)

The unmodified MDH2 is shown in blue and green while the modified form is shown in red.

After simulation, the overall protein structures are similar. Interaction with ASP 64 not observed in the unmodified enzyme.

## Comparison of the mimic and the authentic PTM
After simulation, dynamics as described by the root mean square fluctuation value were compared.
